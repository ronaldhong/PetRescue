<p>
I'm rewriting the <a href = "https://github.com/ronaldhong/PetImage">PetImage</a> project, the new PetRescue project will share similar purpose, that is to allow anyone to share infomation about animal in need.
</p>
<p>
Project Goal: PetRescue is designed to help the street animals. Animal overpopulation is the major challenge for Houston. 
Houston requires estimated 70,000 spay & neuter surgeris to control the problem each year. Animal overpopulation also creates problem with animal-vehicle accident, property damage, and human injuries.

This App will allow registered users to receive information regarding Animal Shelter, spay & neuter Program in Greater Houston Area. Also, if an animal rescue is required, users can also report it on here. we use Mapbox (similar to Google Map)
to help user pinpoint the location on the map.
